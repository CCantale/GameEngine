  LEMME GameEngine

  The LEMME game engine makes large use of the Simple DirectMedia Layer frame-
  work (SDL), though any flaws found in the engine must be addressed solely to
  its own far-from-perfect code.
  What stands for SDL in terms of licence, stands for LEMME as well. Therefore
  we quote here the same words used in the SDL.h file:

  This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied
  warranty.  In no event will the authors be held liable for any damages
  arising from the use of this software.

  Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,

  freely, subject to the following restrictions:

  1. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must not
     claim that you wrote the original software. If you use this software
     in a product, an acknowledgment in the product documentation would be

  2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be
     misrepresented as being the original software.
  3. This notice may not be removed or altered from any source distribution.
